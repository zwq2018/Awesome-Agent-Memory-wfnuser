# Awesome Agent Memory [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated collection of papers, projects, frameworks, and benchmarks on **memory systems for AI agents** — covering how agents encode, store, retrieve, evolve, and forget information across interactions.

> Memory is increasingly recognized as the bottleneck of agentic intelligence. While model capabilities continue to scale, the ability to *persistently learn from experience, adapt over time, and act with coherence across long horizons* depends fundamentally on how memory is designed. This repository tracks the frontier of this fast-moving field.

## Why Agent Memory?

Foundation model-based agents are being deployed in high-stakes settings — from software engineering and scientific discovery to autonomous web interaction and financial trading. Their effectiveness hinges not only on reasoning ability, but on **memory**: how they retain context across sessions, consolidate experiences into reusable knowledge, and selectively forget what is no longer relevant.

Agent Memory differs from LLM Memory (static, parametric retention of training data) and traditional RAG (retrieve-then-read over a fixed corpus). It is **online, interaction-driven, and under the agent's active control**, spanning three forms of storage:

- **Token-level memory**: External text/vector stores with retrieval pipelines
- **Parametric memory**: Knowledge encoded in model weights, updated via continual learning or experience distillation
- **Latent memory**: KV caches, learned memory tokens, and hidden state representations

And serving three functional roles:

- **Factual memory**: What the agent knows (facts, user preferences, world knowledge)
- **Experiential memory**: What the agent has done (episodes, trajectories, outcomes)
- **Working memory**: What the agent is currently attending to (task state, active context)
